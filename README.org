* Nightfetch
*** A flexible system information tool written in Nim

** OS support
Nightfetch is built on Linux-specific directories so it may not work on other systems. 
FreeBSD and OpenBSD are technically in the distro list, but are untested.

** Source support
Nightfetch supports these sources:
- ~os~ - ~/etc/os-release~
- ~cpu~ - ~/proc/cpuinfo~
- ~mem~ - ~/proc/meminfo~
- ~uptime~ - ~/proc/uptime~
- ~kernel~ - ~/proc/sys/kernel/arch~, ~/proc/sys/kernel/hostname~, ~/proc/sys/kernel/osrelease~, ~/proc/sys/kernel/ostype~
- ~board~ - ~/sys/devices/virtual/dmi/id/board_name~, ~/sys/devices/virtual/dmi/id/board_vendor~, ~/sys/devices/virtual/dmi/id/board_version~
- ~host:name~ - ~/etc/hostname~
- ~distro~ - your distro's logo and package manager
- ~env~ - envvars

** Configuration
By default, the config file is located in ~$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/nightfetch/config~ or ~$HOME/.config/nightfetch/config~

*** How to include info from sources
To include a variable, use ~{source:key}~ in your config.
Key naming is as follows:

- ~os~, ~cpu~, ~mem~  - as in source, *all lowercase*
  - ~cpu~ - only ~vendor~, ~model~, ~name~, ~threads~, ~cores~, ~mhz_$core~, ~ghz_$core~
  - ~mem~ - only fields containing ~Total~ or ~Free~ and ~swapused~, ~memused~ in kb, mb, gb(suffix with ~_kb~, ~_mb~, ~_gb~ respectively)
- ~uptime~ - ~uptime_hours~, ~uptime_mins~ and ~uptime_secs~ for hours, minutes and seconds
- ~kernel~ - ~arch~, ~hostname~, ~osrelease~, ~ostype~, all corresponding to the file of the same name
- ~board~ - ~name~, ~vendor~, ~version~, all corresponding to board_$key
- ~host~ - only ~name~ - contents of ~/etc/hostname~
- ~distro~ - ~pm_name~ - the name of distro's package manager, ~pm_count~ - number of packages installed, ~color~ - used in ~{cauto}~, ~logo_tiny~ - distro's logo as in [[https://www.nerdfonts.com/][nerd fonts]][fn:1], ~logo_$i~ - distro's logo line by line
- ~env~ - environment variable name verbatim

*** Styling
Nightfetch supports these styles:
- ~{ }~ - clear all prior styling(including colors)
- ~{b}~ - bold
- ~{d}~ - dim
- ~{i}~ - italic
- ~{u}~ - underline

and these colors:
- ~{cauto}~ - primary color of your distro
- ~{c0}~ - black
- ~{c1}~ - red
- ~{c2}~ - green
- ~{c3}~ - yellow
- ~{c4}~ - blue
- ~{c5}~ - magenta
- ~{c6}~ - cyan
- ~{c7}~ - white

*** Comments
All lines that start with ~#~ are ignored

** Command line parameters:
- ~-c/--config /path/to/config~ - change path to config
- ~-l/--config logo~ - change ~distro:logo_tiny~, ~distro:logo_$i~ and ~distro:color~ to that of ~logo~
- ~-h/--help~ - show help


[fn:1: opensuse-tumbleweed, opensuse-leap and pureos don't have nf icons, so they're substituted by similar-looking characters]
